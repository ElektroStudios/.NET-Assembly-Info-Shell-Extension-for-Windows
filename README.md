# .NET Assembly Info

.NET Assembly Info is a Windows property sheet shell-extension for .NET assemblies.

This shell-extension can help you to obtain basic information of any .NET assembly (.dll and .exe files) via the ***File -> Properties*** window dialog.

See screenshots below to know what information you can obtain. Future updates of this software will include more interesting things.
